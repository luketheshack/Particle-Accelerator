Particle accelerator simulation using the periodic table of elements!

After starting the game, you will be prompted to enter the atomic numbers of two different elements of your choice. Please ensure they are valid atomic numbers of currently known elements! A simulation of the two particles colliding will then begin, and the new element will be shown. Next, enter 'r' to restart or 'q' to quit. Please only enter one character.

Good luck, and happy colliding!
