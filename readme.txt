Particle accelerator simulation using the periodic table of elements!

After starting the game, you will be prompted to enter the atomic numbers of two different elements of your choice. Please ensure they are valid atomic numbers of currently known elements! A simulation of the two particles colliding will then begin, and the new element will be shown. Next, enter 'r' to restart or 'q' to quit. Please only enter one character.

The particles change color as they move to give a more realistic feeling to the collider, and the simulation also speeds up as the particles get closer to make it seem more real. 

Good luck, and happy colliding!
